# About Me
I am **Doyeon Kim**, an undergraduate researcher in Computer Science & Engineering at **Sogang University**.  
My research focuses on **multimodal search agents**, **Agentic RAG**, **LLM reasoning**, and **efficient tensor computation on GPUs**.  
I aim to build lightweight and reliable AI systems that can reason, retrieve, and interact intelligently with real-world information.

## Research Interests
- **Reasoning in Intelligent Systems**  
  Logical, commonsense, and context-aware reasoning for robust decision-making.

- **Multimodal Understanding**  
  Integrating vision and language to develop grounded world models and improve retrieval quality.

- **Interactive & Embodied Agents**  
  Agents that actively explore, crop, and refine visual information during search.

- **Efficient AI Systems**  
  Tensor decomposition, CUDA optimization, and Tensor-Core–accelerated computation for scalable deployment.
